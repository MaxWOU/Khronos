                        Real-time chat is intended for quick help. If a student's needs require significant time then politely recommend
                        they visit the tutoring center or schedule a tutoring session.

                    <p>
                        Real-time chat is intended for use while you are scheduled in the tutoring center. If you would like to work with a student
                        outside your normal tutoring hours please recommend they schedule a tutoring session so that you are compensated for your time.
