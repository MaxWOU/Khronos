## Khronos Team Project
### Beyond the Tutor

Khronos has decided to take on a project to create a Tutoring service for the Computer Science Department at Western Oregon University.
We decided to take on this project because the Computer Science Department does not currently have a modern tutoring system. With the expansion
of the Computer Science field, we believe that our department deserves the best technology they can get their hands on to assist the learning environment for 
current and future Computer Science students; Khronos aims to bring that vision to life for their tutoring program.
