Primary Stakeholder -- Dr. Becka Morgan, professor with the Western Oregon University Computer Science Department and hopeful entrepreneur              
CSD tutoring at WOU is outdated and inefficient. There is little online presence and most tasks are done on paper. This leads to poor communication between tutors and students, a payroll system that doesn't lend itself to easy logging, and professors in the dark regarding student needs. Dr. Morgan wants to create a system that brings tutoring into 2020 and provides a useful platform for everyone connected to the department. Dr. Morgan is hiring your team to create the product.
